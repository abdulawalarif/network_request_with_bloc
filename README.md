# Network Request with Bloc

## This Flutter and Dart project demonstrates how to send network requests using the Bloc pattern. It fetches data from two different API endpoints and displays is on a list, And this stracture also optimized performance through caching to prevent double network call.

The project provides a solid foundation for developers looking to implement network-based features in their applications using Flutterâ€™s Bloc architecture. It includes features like data loading from multiple sources, caching of responses, and efficient UI updates when data changes.

## Features
* Picks a random String from a list.
* Uses of Cubit in  state management with bloc.
* Updates the UI with a new random name when a button is pressed.
